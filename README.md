BREATH-BASED BIO SIGNAL ANALYZER FOR DISEASE DETECTION 

A non-invasive diagnostic tool leveraging gas sensors and deep learning to detect diseases through exhaled breath biomarkers.

Breath analysis has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for disease detection by examining volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other biomarkers present in human breath. This approach leverages advancements in technology to improve diagnostic accuracy and facilitate early disease detection.

Key Features
Biomedical Sensor Array: Utilizes MOS sensors (MiCS-5524, TGS 822) and environmental sensors (DHT22) to detect disease-specific VOCs like acetone (diabetes), benzene (lung cancer), and Hâ‚‚S/methane (GI disorders).
AI-Driven Classification: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on hybrid datasets (real-time + UCI pre-existing data) for high-accuracy disease prediction.
Real-Time Processing: Arduino/Raspberry Pi integration enables on-device analysis with immediate results.

Technical Implementation
Hardware: Metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors for VOC detection, paired with microcontrollers for signal acquisition.
Software: Custom CNN architecture for time-series breath data analysis, optimized with TensorFlow/Keras.
Data Pipeline: Combines sensor fusion, noise filtering, and feature extraction to address low-concentration VOC challenges.

Innovation
Hybrid Dataset Approach: Enhances model robustness by merging real-time sensor data with standardized datasets.
Edge AI Deployment: Focuses on resource-efficient inference for embedded systems, prioritizing portability and cost-effectiveness.

Future Directions
Sensor array optimization for improved specificity.
Multi-disease classification models (COPD, asthma).
Clinical validation trials for real-world reliability.
