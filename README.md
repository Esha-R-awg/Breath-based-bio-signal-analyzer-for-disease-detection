# Breath-based-bio-signal-analyzer-for-disease-detection

A non-invasive diagnostic tool leveraging gas sensors and deep learning to detect diseases through exhaled breath biomarkers.

üîç Key Features
Biomedical Sensor Array: Utilizes MOS sensors (MiCS-5524, TGS 822) and environmental sensors (DHT22) to detect disease-specific VOCs like acetone (diabetes), benzene (lung cancer), and H‚ÇÇS/methane (GI disorders).
AI-Driven Classification: Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on hybrid datasets (real-time + UCI pre-existing data) for high-accuracy disease prediction.
Real-Time Processing: Arduino/Raspberry Pi integration enables on-device analysis with immediate results.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation
Hardware: Metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors for VOC detection, paired with microcontrollers for signal acquisition.
Software: Custom CNN architecture for time-series breath data analysis, optimized with TensorFlow/Keras.
Data Pipeline: Combines sensor fusion, noise filtering, and feature extraction to address low-concentration VOC challenges.

üöÄ Innovation
Hybrid Dataset Approach: Enhances model robustness by merging real-time sensor data with standardized datasets.
Edge AI Deployment: Focuses on resource-efficient inference for embedded systems, prioritizing portability and cost-effectiveness.

üîÆ Future Directions
Sensor array optimization for improved specificity.
Multi-disease classification models (COPD, asthma).
Clinical validation trials for real-world reliability.

(Designed to bridge gaps in non-invasive diagnostics by tackling hardware limitations and algorithmic precision.)
